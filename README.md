# weatherApp
Hello !!!
A few days ago I started my journey with React. I have wanted to get rest from my University tasks and programming in Java and learn something more interesting to me. 
After watching many videos and learning about several mechanisms of React the App idea was born. That's how I started creating weather App. 
I hope you enjoy using this app as much as i did when i built it.
